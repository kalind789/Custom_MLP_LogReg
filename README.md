# Custom MLP and Logistic Regression Implementation

This project implements a Logistic Regression model and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using NumPy, featuring a custom backpropagation algorithm for training.

## Overview

- **Logistic Regression**: Designed for binary classification with custom gradient descent.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Includes:
  - Backpropagation for weight updates
  - Activation functions like ReLU and SoftMax
  - L2 regularization to reduce overfitting

## Performance

- **Rain Dataset**: Achieved ~80% accuracy.
- **Loans Dataset**: Achieved ~70% accuracy.

## Usage

- Clone the repository and ensure Python and NumPy are installed.
- Load your dataset and preprocess as needed.
- Instantiate the `LogisticRegression` or `MLP` class, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## Results

| Model               | Dataset       | Accuracy  |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | Rain Dataset  | ~80%      |
| MLP                 | Loans Dataset | ~70%      |
